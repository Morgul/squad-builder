# Squad Builder lives up to it's name

This marks the first time that Squad Builder can actually live up to it's name. You can currently build squads, save and
delete them. Work has begun on the "My Squads" page, but for now it works well enough that locally I'm able to use it to
generate build mats, and play without needing the cards.

We've got a long way to go before we're ready to release this into the wild, but this is a milestone to be proud of!
