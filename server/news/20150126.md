# Version `1.0.0-rc.1` has landed!

This is a very exciting version for us. It includes all of the launch featured we've been working on
implementing over the last few months. Everything's here, we just need to iron out any bugs left in
the implementation, and possibly smooth out some UI issues.

The highlights of this release are:

* Huge ship support
* Ship 'build-mat' style printing
* Squadron saving and sharing support
* Collection support

That being said, it's likely that there are some bugs. If you run into any issues, please
[file a bug report](https://github.com/Morgul/FFSquadBuilder/issues/new) on GitHub. We'll try to take care of it as
quickly as possible.

It's been an exciting month for us! Hope you enjoy the new features!
